I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. 

I completed my Bachelor's from BITS Pilani in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 
where I explored various engineering domains surrounding areas of 
Computer Science (especially AI/Data Science) and Electronics. 
During my undergrad college time, I had completed internships in the domains of 
Data Science (Machine Learning, Deep Learning (NLP), Statistics) and SDE, 
Analog and Digital Electronics and Electrical engineering.

I have more than 3 years of experience as an MLE at Comcast in their Applied Division, 
where I contributed and was one of a core member in the development and scaling of AI4Ops platform 
which is now being used for their enterprise-wide AI-powered intelligent monitoring and orchestrating company software.
In a semester long internship with Jupiter (fintech unicorn startup in India) in their Data Science team, 
I gained a lot of professional level practices to be followed in Software Dev apart from several cutting-edge 
AI related projects.

My current passion lies in exploring the potential of AI, particularly in the areas of Reinforcement Learning 
and its application for NLP and CV problems. Apart from this I'm interested in a lot of things like 
Physics, Maths, Semiconductor, Engineering, Sports, Finance, etc. 

I am currently looking forward to connecting with professionals (both research or engineering) and 
engaging in opportunities in AI and Software Engineering, to create innovative and helpful tech.
